## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want to sell my digital products (courses, ebooks, online trainings) on a marketplace, either individually or through a subscription, so that I can generate revenue from my content. As a customer, I want to browse and purchase digital products from various creators.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a content creator is logged in, **When** they navigate to the products section, **Then** they should be able to create, update, and delete their products.
2. **Given** a customer is on the marketplace, **When** they select a product, **Then** they should be able to purchase it individually or subscribe to the creator's content.
3. **Given** a creator has made a sale, **When** they view their sales report, **Then** they should see the correct revenue share (85% for individual products, 90% for subscriptions).

### Edge Cases
