# Implementation Plan: Digital Product Marketplace for Content Creators

**Branch**: `001-this-application-is` | **Date**: 2025-10-06 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/flaviobarros/Developer/lionduzz/specs/001-this-application-is/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
A marketplace for content creators to sell digital products, with features like individual and subscription sales, revenue sharing, and management tools. The technical approach includes a Vite frontend, NestJS backend, PostgreSQL database, Firebase for authentication and storage, Stripe for payments, and Mux for video streaming.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite, React, NestJS, Firebase, Stripe, Mux
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (local), Firebase Storage
**Testing**: Jest, Cypress
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads, responsive UI.
**Constraints**: Initial market is Brazil.
**Scale/Scope**: Scalable to support a growing number of users and products.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] **Clean Architecture**: The design separates concerns by using a frontend and backend structure, and the backend will follow clean architecture principles.
- [X] **SOLID Principles**: The proposed design will adhere to SOLID principles.
- [X] **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The design will be centered around the domain model and business logic.
- [X] **LGPD Compliance**: The application will be designed with data privacy and security in mind to comply with LGPD.
- [X] **Observability**: The design will include logging, metrics, and tracing.
- [X] **Monitoring**: There will be plans for monitoring the health and performance of the system.
- [X] **CI/CD**: The plan accounts for automated testing and deployment.

**Structure Decision**: The project will be structured as a monorepo with a `frontend` and `backend` package.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research best practices for integrating Stripe with NestJS.
   - Research best practices for integrating Firebase Authentication with NestJS.
   - Research best practices for using Mux for video streaming.

2. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User, Product, Sale, Subscription

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `/contracts/`:
   - Endpoints for authentication, products, sales, and subscriptions.

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`.

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh gemini`

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI

**Estimated Output**: 30-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [X] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [X] Complexity deviations documented
